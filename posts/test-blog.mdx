# The Rise of AI in Africa

Africa is on the verge of a technological leap. With increasing internet access and a surge in developer communities, artificial intelligence is becoming a major player in driving innovation on the continent.

<HighlightBox message="AI can solve Africa's most pressing problems—if developed locally and ethically." />

## Sectors Being Transformed

- **Healthcare**: Disease prediction, diagnostics, and remote consultations.
- **Agriculture**: AI-powered crop monitoring and weather prediction.
- **Fintech**: Fraud detection, credit scoring, and mobile banking.

## Final Thoughts

The key to Africa’s AI revolution lies in empowering local talent and ensuring equitable access to tools and education.

### ✨ Bonus

With MDX, you can use **React components directly**. For example, the `HighlightBox` above is a custom React component.

## ✅ Step 3: Add a `HighlightBox.tsx` component (optional)

If you're using components like `<HighlightBox />`, define them like this:

```tsx
// components/HighlightBox.tsx
export default function HighlightBox({ message }: { message: string }) {
  return (
    <div className="bg-yellow-100 border-l-4 border-yellow-500 text-yellow-900 p-4 rounded-md my-4">
      {message}
    </div>
  );
}
